    "career": "I'm Lukas, 30 years old and I recently completed my dual study programme. I completed my B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the FH Aachen and at the same time successfully mastered my training as a Mathematical-Technical Software Developer (MATSE) at adesso SE. Before I discovered my passion for software development, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Applied Geography at RWTH Aachen University. During my apprenticeship at adesso SE in the ITS Core Team (Investment Technology Solutions Core) I was able to gain wide experience with both frontend and backend technologies. A large part of my training was spent with React, NextJS and Typescript, but I also enjoy developing in C#.",
    "hobbies": "In my free time, besides software development, I am interested in all kinds of technology. Apart from 3D printing and working with 3D CAD programs, I am currently enthusiastic about home automation with a small home server, home assistant and various small Shelly modules. I am also a sport addict and enjoy spending time in nature."

It is the frontend for displaying and managing data from the Identity Manager, Session Manager and Audittrail services. At the time of my employment, the admin shell written in Angular was to be completely rebuilt in React and Next.js. I supported the senior developers and was able to help design the new application."

      "description": "My Battlefield Lobby is a hobby project that was born out of a passion for the Battlefield series. With the help of the open REST API https://api.gametools.network, I have created a website that allows you to find your current game lobby and display the data of your fellow players. This allows you to quickly check whether a teammate or opponent is an obvious cheater. The application is hosted as an Azure Static Web App as a free plan."

      "title": "Trash Tracker",
      "description": "The Trash Tracker app is used to locate littered places around the world and mark them on a map. This gives hard-working helpers the opportunity to visit these places, collect the waste and remove the marker from the map.  I had the idea for the Trash Tracker app for some time. The first prototype was realised as part of an Android course at university. Using a small .NET web api as a backend, an Android app was written that enables basic functions such as adding markers with descriptions and images and completing these tasks. Additionally, a simple authentication with .NET was integrated. Open Street Map was used for the map."

      "description": "VEDA used a time tracker from the Tempo plugin for its time recording in Jira. After the update to a new Jira version, however, this was no longer compatible and this resulted in the task of our university project. We wrote a desktop app for VEDA that is platform-independent and automates time tracking. The app allows users to log in with their Jira credentials using basic authentication, search and filter their tickets, track times for a selected ticket and then automatically create a work log in Jira."
