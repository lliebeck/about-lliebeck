    "career": "I am Lukas, 29 years old and have recently completed my dual education as a MATSE. Before I discovered my passion for software development, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Applied Geography at RWTH Aachen University. During my apprenticeship at adesso SE in the ITS Core Team (Investment Technology Solutions Core) I was able to gain wide experience with both frontend and backend technologies. A large part of my training was spent with React, NextJS and Typescript, but I also enjoy developing in C#.",
